Hi, my name is Artur and I am 23 years old. At the moment I am a 7th semester engineering student with a major in computer science at the Pedagogical University of Cracow. I'm studying programming - WebDeveloper as a full stack developer based on Vue.js framework. At the moment I am at the stage of writing an engineering project as a backend devloper on Laravel technology. I am in the process of learning this technology, of course, as this is my first project related to this language. 

## My workstation
Currently, my post looks like this. I know that one photo may not give everything away, but practically everything I need for daily study and work is on it. I plan to expand the workstation, add a fourth monitor for work, and eventually replace the square one with a similar model to the others to create a comprehensive workstation based on 24 inches. Why as many as four monitors? When I write projects in several technologies at the same time and read information, I need space for everything. Now, learning and working on projects as a full stack, it really helps because I don't have to switch tabs all the time - everything is open, and changes, editors, etc. are visible in real time.

## How does the plaza develop 🌱🌱🌱
I have some ideas on how to polish my Web Developer knowledge.
- The project currently in development is a commercial venture. Specifically, it is a project to develop a website for my mother's business, which has a significant number of target customers.
- To improve my English language skills. This is very important to me.
- Reading the book "Clean Code" to improve my writing skills.

These are my immediate goals to achieve.
