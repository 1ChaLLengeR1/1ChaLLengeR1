# About me:
Hello, my name is Artur, and I am 24 years old. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Pedagogical University of Krakow. Currently, I help with the family business, performing seasonal duties. In my free time, I frequently ride my bike. For my technological self-development, I am currently working on another project for my portfolio, focusing on diet, statistics, and self-improvement.

## My workstation
Currently, my setup looks like this. I know that one photo may not capture everything, but it shows practically everything I need for my daily study and work. I plan to expand the workstation by adding a fourth monitor for work and eventually replacing the square one with a similar model to the others to create a comprehensive workstation based on 24-inch screens. Why as many as four monitors? When I work on projects in several technologies simultaneously and read information, I need space for everything. Now, learning and working on projects as a full-stack developer, it really helps because I don't have to switch tabs all the time‚Äîeverything is open, and changes, editors, etc., are visible in real-time.

## How the Plan Develops üå±üå±üå±
I have some ideas on how to enhance my Web Developer knowledge:
- Improve my English language skills, which is very important to me.
- Read the book "Clean Code" to improve my coding skills.

These are my immediate goals to achieve.
